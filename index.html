        Engineer, 23 years old, single. I strive to get more opportunities for professional development.
        At the moment I am engaged in servicing computer equipment and peripheral devices, building a local computer network.
        Additionally, I temporarily held the position of secretary and performed the work of the procurement department of a state institution.
        I am engaged in the development of postcards and leaflets for the maternity hospital in the Minsk region.
        Some of my hobbies include stretching and traveling to historical places in Belarus.
